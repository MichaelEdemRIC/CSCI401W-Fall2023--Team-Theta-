## Executive Summary
Pawsome Prices will search multiple stores/sites for pet products and return the best prices for the desired product.

---

## Product Vision
Wanted to make a site that did price comparisons for products of certain categories. We decided on pet products because it seemed like an untapped area, with little competition from larger/well known sites, and could give value to pet owners. These kinds of websites, which are in certain niches, save users time and money by not having to search through many sites for the products. Since there aren't sites specific to the pet market, unlike electronics or PC parts, this niche is an area that we can work in to solve the problem for pet owners.

---

## Vision Statement
FOR pet owners WHO want to save time and money on pet products, Pawsome Prices is a site/app THAT will compare prices for products that users can search for, saving them time and money to get the best deal. UNLIKE similar sites that search for all products, OUR PRODUCT focuses on the specific niche, pet products, and will make it more convenient for users who are searching for products in this area, saving them time and money.

## Risks
- the site isn't popular, nobody cares about these deals
- while we're developing, a competitor brings a similar product to market
- a bigger/well-known company moves into this area (Google Shopping, etc.)
- the development team doesn't have the experience to integrate all the various areas into one product
