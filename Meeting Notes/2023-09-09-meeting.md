#### Product Ideas
- random walking path
  - given a desired timeframe or miles, return a random path that starts and ends at the same location
  - would need to use GPS and data from Google maps or Open Street maps
  - a POC could have it take data from one area of the state
- meet in the middle
  - multiple people want to meet up to have a drink or eat. the app will find a location that is close to the middle of everybody, that way everybody drives a similar distance
  - on maps app calculate where everyone is and what's around the middle all of them, and find locations that fit where we're looking for
  - unsure of where to pull this data from yet
  - need to figure out how to link users together
  - need to have an account creation method
- storage app
- online shopping helper 
  - looks for sales from various websites for products that we're looking for
  - like a pc parts picker, but for another genre
