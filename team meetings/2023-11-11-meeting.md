### 🗒️ **Notes**:
- Created a skeleton of the user side of the website with a home page and search results page using dummy JSON files, need to test with api calls.
- Started working on a login page and account system for wishlists and admin privileges.
- Started working on a way to retrieve data from Amazon.com and Walmart.com.
- Cannot use official APIs and Walmart has anti-scraping measures, so we discussed how we might proceed, potentially with just dummy data based on the real websites for now.
